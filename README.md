Basic functions - 

Simple search program that parses Watchout's clipboard data for the user's entry
Copy all aux timelines to the clipboard and run the search with a keyword or the full filename.

IMPORTANT - I haven't accounted for the user entering Watchout's own keywords.. If you put something like 
"Struct" or "float" you will get incorrect data, but no errors.
